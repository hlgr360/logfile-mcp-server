# ADR_20250728_02: Adopt UV for Python Package Management

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The project was initially set up using traditional Python package management tools (pip + venv). However, `uv` offers significant advantages for modern Python development:

### Current State
- Using standard `pip` for package installation
- Using `venv` for virtual environment management
- Traditional `setuptools` build system in `pyproject.toml`
- Slower dependency resolution and installation times

### UV Advantages
1. **Performance**: 10-100x faster than pip for package installation and dependency resolution
2. **Better Dependency Resolution**: More reliable conflict detection and resolution
3. **Modern Tooling**: Built-in virtual environment management with `uv venv`
4. **Unified Interface**: Single tool for package management, environment creation, and project running
5. **Future-Proof**: Actively developed by the Astral team (makers of Ruff)
6. **Drop-in Replacement**: Compatible with existing `pyproject.toml` and requirements

## Decision
Switch the Log Analysis Application to use `uv` as the primary Python package management tool.

### Implementation Changes
1. **Update .gitignore**: Add uv-specific patterns
2. **Modify pyproject.toml**: Optimize for uv usage
3. **Update README**: Replace pip commands with uv equivalents
4. **Development Workflow**: Use uv for all package operations

### Migration Strategy
- **Phase 1**: Update configuration files and documentation
- **Phase 2**: Verify all dependencies work with uv
- **Phase 3**: Update development scripts and CI/CD (future)

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Faster Development**: Significantly reduced package installation times
- **Better Reliability**: More robust dependency resolution
- **Improved Developer Experience**: Single tool for environment management
- **Modern Best Practices**: Aligns with current Python ecosystem trends
- **Compatibility**: Works with existing pyproject.toml structure

### Negative
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn uv commands (minimal - very similar to pip)
- **Tool Dependency**: Requires uv installation on development machines
- **Early Adoption Risk**: uv is newer than pip (though stable and widely adopted)

### Neutral
- **Configuration Changes**: Minor updates to project files needed
- **Documentation Updates**: README and development guides need updating

## Implementation Details

### Required Changes
1. Update `.gitignore` with uv-specific patterns
2. Add uv installation instructions to README
3. Replace pip commands with uv equivalents in documentation
4. Update development workflow to use `uv run` for script execution

### Command Mappings
```bash
# Old (pip/venv)
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
pip install pytest

# New (uv)
uv venv
uv pip install -e .
uv pip install pytest
# or even simpler:
uv run python -m app.main --help
```

## Migration Checklist
- [ ] Update .gitignore for uv patterns
- [ ] Update README with uv installation and usage
- [ ] Verify all dependencies install correctly with uv
- [ ] Update development documentation
- [ ] Test application startup with uv environment
- [ ] Update any scripts or automation to use uv
